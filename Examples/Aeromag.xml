Upon receipt of digital data from the field, the magnetic values were checked by calculating fourth differences and preparing an error list. Single, bad magnetometer values were corrected automatically. The noise spikes were removed without making any changes in the neighbouring magnetic measurements as opposed to linear smoothing or filtering routines that would mix good and bad values indiscriminately. More complex errors were corrected manually, on the basis of the fourth differences, before proceeding.
Tests were applied by a geophysicist to determine whether systematic corrections should be applied as follows:
• Lag: The lag test data were analyzed to see if the magnetometer data should be time-shifted to ensure proper synchronization with the flight path.
• Air minus ground: The airborne magnetic data were not corrected for diurnal drift. Tests showed that subtraction of ground from airborne magnetometer data did not improve the overall quality.
Tie line intercept methods were employed. Intersections of each line and control line were calculated from the flight path data. Differences in total magnetic intensity from the two measurements, on line and tie line, were calculated, and automatically analyzed to produce a pattern of smooth adjustments to level the data together. The computer program used a repetitive routine, first to establish datum shifts for whole line and tie lines, and then to introduce a variable shift along each one. The locations of intersections, in zones of steep magnetic gradient, were slightly adjusted, rather than making any erratic datum shifts. Any intersections that could not be levelled within the specified program thresholds were listed and manually checked to determine what corrections were required.
The differences at the intersection points were tabulated on a printed output from the computer program in a readily comprehensible form. Differences, at all intersections, were carefully analyzed and distributed proportionally along the control lines and the traverse lines to yield an identical final total field value for both lines at the given intersection.
Final values were then assigned to the traverse profiles at the appropriate intersections and used as corrections to the digitally-recorded values along the traverse lines. In areas of steep magnetic gradient and/or of rugged topographic relief, the intersection adjustments could be deleted or an appropriate adjustment assigned to the traverse line. These adjustments or deletions were noted as part of the levelling tabulation.
A graphical plot of the final total field level adjustments along the traverse lines was produced.
GDS used Geosoft software packages to do detailed visual analysis of the total field and calculated vertical gradient magnetic grids to create image quality final magnetic grids. Programs that perform microlevelling, which can remove minor imperfections visible in shadow images, were also used. These produced grids of exceptional aesthetic quality with no degradation of the high frequency content of the data.
A square grid was calculated from the levelled traverse and control line data. The grid-cell size was 20 metres. Gridding was carried out using the minimum curvature technique (Briggs, 1974), which honours all traverse and control line data while producing a surface for which the total curvature is minimised.
Interceptions out of the “model” were removed in every step.
Microlevelling was done locally around strong anomalies using the following procedure. A decorrugation grid was calculated using a combination of Butterworth (400 m, 6 orders, HighPass) and Directional Cosine (359°, 1.5 orders, Pass). The error was clipped at 5 nT and masked (0) outside of the applied polygon and then filtered using a Butterworth (800 m, 4 order, LowPass).
A Residual Magnetic Intensity was then calculated removing the IGRF with a constant date (April 2nd, 2008) and altitude (390 m).
In order to drape the magnetic data onto the Ontario Single Master Magnetic Datum, the residual magnetic field, the “GSC levelling” process was then applied to the IGRF-corrected residual magnetic field (see Appendix B - GSC Levelling). The resulting channel was then gridded using the minimum curvature algorithm and a cell size of 20 m, to prepare the grid of GSC levelled residual magnetic field.

After GSC levelling was applied to both the residual magnetic field channels (measured and gradient-enhanced), the corresponding magnetic grids were calculated from the final reprocessed profiles by a minimum curvature algorithm. The accuracy standard for gridding is that the grid values fit the profile data to within 0.001 nT for 99.99% of the profile data points, for 100 iterations (or 0.00001 nT/m for the horizontal gradient data). The average gridding error is well below 0.1 nT.
Minimum curvature gridding provides the smoothest possible grid surface that also honours the profile line data. However, sometimes this can cause narrow linear anomalies cutting across flight lines to appear as a series of isolated spots. This effect is minimized in the gradient-enhanced residual field grids.
The first vertical derivative of the magnetic field is the rate of change of the magnetic field in the vertical direction while the second vertical derivative is the rate of change of the vertical gradient. Computation of the first and second vertical derivative removes long-wavelength features of the magnetic field and significantly improves the resolution of closely spaced and superposed anomalies. The values for the first and second vertical derivative of the magnetic field were computed directly from the gridded residual magnetic intensity data using a fast Fourier transform, combining the transfer functions of the first (or second) vertical derivative and an eighth-order Butterworth low-pass filter (100 m cut-off wave-length). The low-pass filter was aimed at attenuating unwanted high frequencies enhanced by the derivative operator. 
The second vertical derivative of the total magnetic field was computed to enhance small and weak near-surface anomalies and as an aid to delineate the contacts of the lithologies having contrasting susceptibilities. The location of contacts or boundaries is usually traced by the zero contour of the second vertical derivative map (Hood, 1965).
